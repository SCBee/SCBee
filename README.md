- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @SCBee (Zachary)! I am a Mechanical Engineering student at the Schulich School of Engineering, University of Calgary. Incoming 4th-year student, intern.

- ðŸ‘€ I have a massive interest in the energy sector (Oil & Gas, Renewables) and hope to pursue a career in it! I also enjoy tinkering with robotics, and gaining insights from data analyses.


- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning technical forecast theories while developing my automated financial market screener. This has been a very interesting project for me since it has given me plenty of challenges and I love being able to see how accurate (and inaccurate) some models are.


- Current Projects:
    1) Automated Financial Market Screening Tool
    2) Oil & Gas Extraction Simulations using Aspen HYSYS, 3DS SIMULIA.
