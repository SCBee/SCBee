- 👋 Hi, I’m @SCBee (Zachary Uy)! You can browse my old projects and I hope you enjoy!

- 👀 I’m interested in reverse engineering gaming applications to create assistance and analytics tools. Recently, I have been learning robotics design!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to implement a kernel driver and how to improve my drone design through CFD analysis of my frame prototypes.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on drone design projects with someone who shares the same level of interest that I do!

- 📫 How to reach me ... Message me!


- Current Software Projects: Poker Game-Theory Optimal Solver using Counterfactual Regret Minimization - Currently finishing up the equity calculation feature.
